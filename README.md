## Agenda of the Project:
The problem statement was to create an application where employees can schedule meetings with their admins/managers using an unique link according to their time slots
available. User can schedule a meeting from admin user link on available time slots. Admin user can create a link for meeting with desired time slots.
While scheduling the meeting, the details should be saved in Google Calender of public and admin user. Integrate any video conferencing platform (ex. Google Meet, Zoom.us, etc.) where the meeting would take place.

## Agenda Achieved:
The project can enable any user to generate meeting links with the manager of their choice based on the time slots available in the admin's schedule for the provided duration. The project allots a meeting link to the generated request and the users can see their meetings on the dashboard. The admins have a different page where they can see all the meetings scheduled with them along with the notes of the topics to be discussed.
